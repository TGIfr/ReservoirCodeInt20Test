# Meme Picker
#### by Reservoir Code Team

Test project for Int20h

Project was designed for admins of popular memes sites to make their life easier.

The essence of the site is to collect memes and give users the opportunity to vote for the best ones. After all there will be a list of most rated memes, so admins can see, what people like.
